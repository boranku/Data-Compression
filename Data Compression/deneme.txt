THE MASTER SPIRIT




CHAPTER I

A DWELLER IN DARKNESS


The light on the Clock Tower, that cheerful beacon which assures
Britons that good and picked men are kept from their beds to raise
the standard of their liberties, and, incidentally, their taxes, had
just gone out, sharply, as though glad to announce to yet-stirring
London a respite from the babble of lawmaking; and the great workshop
of Westminster where the artisans are so many and busy, and the
results perhaps so meagre, discharged its crowd into the illuminated
night. Out they came hurrying, for the hour was late: the sitting had
been animated and prolonged, and even professional, to say nothing
of casual, politicians are nowadays too busy in wasting the nation’s
time not to set a high value on their own. Out they streamed, still
chattering and arguing, as became the priests in that great Temple of
the Tongue, those of them whose voices were seldom heard and never
listened to in the House talking the loudest outside; a varied crew
typifying the component parts of their country’s greatness. Ministers,
bent, fine-drawn and unkempt, as men whose ceaseless rolling of
Sisyphian stones gave no time to spare for the clothes-brush, superior
Under-Secretaries, some dapper, others affecting a soul and a mission
above the niceties of costume, all far more important than any Prime
Minister who ever lived, and displaying a pretty contempt for those of
the rank and file who took upon themselves to criticise the conduct of
the debate; then the mob of hungry politicians, keen hustlers; here
sharp-faced wood-cutters in the tangled forests of the Law, each with
his axe to grind; there egotistical, opulent tradesmen, members by
virtue of contributions to the Party coffers, and with a never-sleeping
eye on the Birthday Honours list; now smart men of leisure gained by
their fathers’ toil, merely adding the House of Commons to their clubs;
and so on, with here and there a single-minded politician who imagined,
misguided man, that he served his country by supporting his own shade
of opinion, seeking nothing for himself, and getting nothing--but
influenza and the privilege of leaving to his party the legacy of an
inconvenient bye-election.

“Capital speech of yours, Herriard. Won’t do you any harm.” The speaker
was a genial, middle-aged man of fashion who liked to be in the House
as he liked to have the _entrée_ everywhere, and to stand well with
everybody from the Premier to the latest blatant labour member.

“Glad you liked it, Sir Henry. I was rather afraid I should be squeezed
out after Darrell’s interminable effort,” answered Herriard, as he
swung himself into a hansom. “Can I give you a lift?”

“Thanks. No. My man ought to be here. Many congratulations. Good-night.”

Herriard nodded and leaned back. “Park Lane,” he called out to the
driver. As the cab turned out of the courtyard the more brilliant
lights of Great George Street fell upon the face within it, that of
a young man, interesting enough, handsome and not without character,
which latter trait was perhaps just then more strongly accentuated than
usual by the illuminating expression of the hour’s success. It was a
face more interesting by its suggestion of possibilities than by any
marked indication of actual, present power.

A short distance up Park Lane Herriard dismissed the cab and walked
on. On his left, under a crescent moon, the Park lay slumbering still,
and, save for a few nocturnal prowlers, lifeless: in vivid contrast to
the still busy, if languid, roll of traffic on the other side of its
railings. Herriard, walking briskly, turned up Hertford Street, and
presently taking a little used thoroughfare, made his way deep into the
intricacies of Mayfair, that curious maze of mansions and slums where
Peers live next door to slop-shops, and the chorus from a footman’s
Free-and-Easy at the public-house across the street may keep awake a
dowager countess or weave melody into ducal dreams.

At the end of an out-of-the-way spur from what was half street, half
mews, Herriard stopped before the old-fashioned portico of a house the
frontage of which, at any rate, was squeezed up in a corner, giving at
the same time a suggestion of greater expansion at the back. A curious
eighteenth century residence, built on unconventional and, with regard
to space, ingeniously utilitarian lines; a house that nineteen out of
twenty passers-by would fail to notice and the twentieth would stop to
wonder at, since the genuinely quaint has of late years in London given
way to the hideously regular or the pretentiously unconventional. As he
reached the projecting doorway, Herriard turned sharply and glanced
back down the short street. He was alone there; obviously no one
without special business would be likely to pass that way. Then he took
out a latch-key and let himself in, passed through an octagon hall hung
with rare tapestry, went up a broad staircase so heavily carpeted that
no footfall could be heard, gave a slight knock at one of the doors on
the square landing, and went in.

If the hall and stairway were marvels of costly decoration, the room
Herriard had entered was, particularly in contrast to the house’s
dingy exterior, a still greater revelation, and, in its bearing upon
the character of the inmate, should have a short word of description.
The walls were hung with dark crimson silk of which, however, little
could be seen between the exquisitely toned frames of the multitudes of
striking pictures, mostly or all of the French school, with which it
was covered. But the whole tone and furniture of the room were French,
and French at its most ingenious and its quaintest. The eye fed on a
mass of art, simple and applied, never flamboyant, and subdued with
such skill and taste that the sense of crowding and profusion was
kept from obtruding itself. Everything was novel, unexpected, and yet
logically fitted to its place, and the general toning-down effect was
aided by the many exquisite bronzes which were placed with an artistic
eye about the room. To make an end, the ceiling was a radiant specimen
of Angelica Kaufmann’s brush-work, showing so little age that the newer
glories below could not kill it, and the floor was covered with a rare
Aubusson of a design that invited and yet defied analysis.

Projecting from one side of the room was a singular piece of furniture,
half bed, half sofa, with a fantastic canopy arranged on carved
supports, and with a coverlet of the finest silk. On this couch lay
a man. The face that, with the exception of a long thin hand resting
on the silken coverlet, was all that could be seen of him, showed a
man of singular power and character. The impression which this vivid
personality gave might be summed up in one word, concentration: intense
concentration physical as well as mental. The dark eyes seemed to
scintillate as under the high pressure of a fully charged brain. The
black hair was clinched close to the head in tight, crisp curls, the
thin lips were compressed, the whole being seemed to palpitate with
concentrated vitality, and yet it was a wreck, or why was he lying
there?

He welcomed Herriard with a smile which held more than mere greeting.

“You are late, Geof. A field-night of course. Well?”

Herriard took the hand that was raised towards him, then wheeled round
a chair and sat down.

“I got on all right.”

“That’s well. So you did speak?”

Herriard nodded. “And, I think, made every point you gave me. They beat
us by only thirty-three.”

The dark eyes lighted up with malicious triumph. “Good! That’s a nasty
rap for Master Askew. We had the logic and they the numbers, eh?”

Herriard gave a short laugh. “Certainly we got in our hits every time.”

“That’s as it should be.”

“They were feeble, and not over-confident after the first hour. It was
quite fun to watch them.”

“Weaklings! Fancy losing their nerve and half their majority. What are
such sheep good for but to follow their leader through the hedge? I
wish I had been there.”

A look of almost passionate regret crossed the man’s face as he spoke
the last words.

“I wish you had, my dear Gastineau. We would have had more fun still,
and they more funk.”

“Congreve?”

“Spoke for twenty minutes. An exhibition of the superior person in the
throes of embarrassment. That point of yours about the repudiation of
the Colonies hit them hard.”

“Ah, you made the most of that. Good! Congreve the Superior could not
touch it?” He spoke eagerly.

“Touch it? He could not get near it. I wished afterwards, as I listened
to his floundering, that I had elaborated it still more.”

Gastineau’s thoughts seemed to be far away; as though he were living in
the scene his brain reconstructed. “I don’t doubt you did very well, my
dear boy,” he murmured, still preoccupied. Suddenly he flashed out with
a spiteful laugh, “The pattern Robert Congreve at a loss! His Baliol
quibbles at a discount for once. Faugh! A brilliant party to depend for
its allies upon the callow prigs of the Oxford Union! Ah, to be back
again! to be back again!” His clenched hand rose and fell; he gave a
great sigh of impotence.

“It is hard on you, old fellow,” Herriard said sympathetically;
“cruelly hard. As it is, I only wish that, as your proxy, I could do
you more justice.”

The look of almost savage impatience on Gastineau’s face had given
place to a quiet smile as he replied. “I could not find a better man
for my purpose, Geof. We must both of us have patience,” he gave a
short bitter laugh, “a virtue that you should find easier to practise
than I, since its exercise need last but a short time with you, while I
must die of it. But the _savoir attendre_ pays, Geof, both in the House
and at the Bar.”

Herriard smiled. “That’s just as well, since one has no option but to
wait.”

Gastineau gave a quick shake of the head. “Many men won’t wait; they
can’t play the game. The world thinks they are waiting, and they
flatter themselves so too. But they are really out of it, Geof. They
have shot their bolt and missed. Why? Because they were in a hurry.
Then there are others, like this fellow Congreve, who get pushed up
by the stupid party that mistakes academical show and froth for real
power. They manage to keep balanced on their pedestals by the weights
of self-advertisement and self-confidence. They act upon the well-known
ethical principle that the majority of mankind, being fools too lazy to
think for themselves, will appraise a man at his own value, if only he
will take care to proclaim the precious figure in season and out. If I
were a living instead of a dead man, Geoffrey, I’d blow that fellow out
of the water in which he swims so complacently.”

Perhaps it was his glance at the malignant face beneath him that made
Herriard remark, “You are a good hater, Gastineau.”

In an instant the sinister expression had relaxed. “Yes,” with a
half-apologetic smile. “I hate prigs and, above all, the superior
person, with his impudence in assuming a rank in the human category to
which he is not in the least entitled. Ah, well, you shall smash him up
for me one of these days, Geof. I’m going to make a real, a brilliant
success of you. When you are perfect in your guard, I am going to
teach you how to hit still harder.”

“It is very good of you.”

“Nonsense! If you knew how much of selfishness there is in my tuition
you would not give me much credit. I shouldn’t expect you to let me
use you as a mask for my battery were it not that the benefits of my
marksmanship go to you. There, that’s enough of that. Now, about these
briefs. I have looked through them.”

“They are all simple enough, eh?”

“Absolutely. In Slater _v._ Sudbury Tramway, though, I should make a
strong point of the contributory negligence and, as a second shot,
cross-examine closely as to the father’s actual income and financial
position and prospects. I see they claim six thousand. A glorious
British jury is pretty sure to find against you, and your best point
will be to suggest a try-on and go for mitigation. There you are.”

He gave Herriard the parcel of briefs with an encouraging smile and nod
of confidence. “Now you had better turn in,” he said, “or you won’t be
fit for Court in the morning. Who tries the tramway case?”

“Gartree.”

“That old fool? He will probably misdirect, and give you a second
chance. Good-night, my dear boy. So glad you scored to-night.”

They shook hands affectionately, and in another minute Herriard, in
spite of a long, exciting day, was walking, with the brisk step of that
elation which knows no fatigue, towards his rooms in Mount Street.




CHAPTER II

THE HISTORY OF A COMPACT


Three years earlier there had been an appalling railway accident
between Cordova and Seville. Two tightly packed trains had come into
collision, with results that had prevented even the Spanish officials
from hushing up the _contretemps_, and had sent an electric wave of
shudders over the whole news-reading world. Among the second division
of its victims, the dangerously, even mortally, wounded, there appeared
one name at least which added, in England, at any rate, to the
sensational interest which for nearly a week the affair induced. It was
that of the most prominent coming man of the day, Paul Gastineau, K.C.,
M.P., a man who had indeed arrived and who was bound, in French phrase,
to go far. Lay politicians were fond of quoting one another that a man
of such marvellous brain-power and capability for hard work had the
easy and certain reversion to the Woolsack: members of his own branch
of the profession, if they did not agree with the forecast, let it pass
unchallenged; while there were many grains of intentional truth in the
chaff indulged in by the other branch when they would declare that the
solicitor, who, having a fighting case on hand, failed to retain Paul
Gastineau, laid himself open to an action for negligence.

For Gastineau was above all things a fighter, and one who fought with
his brains as well as with his tongue; a distinction which they who
know courts of law will readily appreciate. An awkward adversary, ever
in deadly earnest, who always fenced with the button off; his enemies
and defeated opponents, and they were many, said not too scrupulously;
but he fought to win, and usually did win, leaving mere niceties and
quibbles to the schoolmen; and to have the knack of winning means much,
if not everything. It meant much for Paul Gastineau. He became the most
talked about man at the Bar, and his enemies being too human to let his
praises pass in silence, simply added their voices to the babble that
made him known. Our forefathers were stupid enough to regard the envy,
hatred and malice that attend on success as something of a drawback;
a toll, they called it, paid for being eminent: we know better, and
nowadays the wisely successful man regards his detractors as a valuable
asset in the working capital on which he pursues the business of
eminence.

Parties in the political world do not look far or seek beneath the
surface for their allies. Perhaps they are too busy, or too lazy; not
to suggest that they are too stupid. Anyhow they have a well-defined
leaning towards ready-made reputations: the practice may be expensive
and exacting, but it saves trouble. Once Gastineau had become an
established success his Party found that they could not do without
him, and to that success and to that discovery did a very worthy and
somnolent brewer, whose legislative faculties appeared to be somewhat
clouded by the fumes of his own ale, owe his more comfortable place of
repose in that honourable, if shunted, _wagon-lit_ called the House of
Lords. Eminent forensic lawyers are often failures in Parliament, and
Gastineau was clever enough at the Bar to make wiseacres pretty sure
of his falling short in the House. But the short-sighted soothsayers
who judge the individual from the aggregate had made no allowance for
a certain quality which, beyond his grit, his talent, and his power of
concentration, was to be an important factor in the success which he
forthwith became. They forgot that he was not altogether an Englishman:
there was Southern blood in his veins, a warmer tinge to his mind;
he had the vivacity and intellectual _chic_ of the Italian added to
the determination of an Englishman. So he rose almost at a bound to a
high position among the legal members of the House, and with that his
position seemed assured.

Naturally when it was seen that this distinguished man was among
the victims of the Spanish railway smash, something like a thrill
ran through the country which was the stage of his career. Society
speculated as to the extent of his injuries and his chance of recovery;
his own profession believed, many of them hoped, that, even if he did
recover, his flight would thenceforward be a drooping one, while our
old friend, the man in the street, always ready with an obvious moral
platitude, made much of the impending sword which Fate hangs over the
heads of even the most brilliantly successful of poor humanity.

Meanwhile in a poor monastery near an obscure Spanish town Gastineau
lay battling with characteristic determination to keep at bay Death
who stood over him. When he had been extricated from the wreckage of
the train he was placed aside on the ground to await means of removal
to the improvised hospital; and he had lain there in what, to a man of
his character and ambition, far exceeded the bitterness of death. His
spine was injured, he felt no pain, was, indeed, scarcely conscious of
the strange numbness and deprivation of all muscular power. But, after
the first stunning shock, his mind had become, even for him, abnormally
clear and alert, the change from lethargic dizziness had come like the
clearing off of vapours from the sun. “Thank Heaven,” he muttered to
himself, “this is the end, the lightning before death; if only it will
come quickly, for all is over with me.”

So in a state of savage, resentful impatience he lay there, looking
up at the stars, all unconcerned in their cold glitter, types of the
all-enduring, which mocked that poor transient clay which had aspired
to be a planet in a system so mundane as to admit of railway accidents;
and as he looked with despairing eyes he cursed them as the unjust
rulers of his fate. Then, for his mind was in too great a state of
exaltation to dwell long on any one thought, before him rose and
passed as in an extraordinarily vivid panorama the salient incidents
of his career, to be succeeded by the principal stages he had been
wont justifiably to picture in his future. Never to be. The past was
all he could claim now; the present was mere impotence, and the future
had vanished at the touch of a sleepy signalman’s hand on the wrong
lever. He ground his teeth as he thought of it; he had a good deal of
cynical philosophy in him, but it failed here, the stake had been too
great, the certainty of winning too absolute for him to regard this
startling reverse with equanimity. Then he came to review his triumphs,
his mistakes, his sins: the last had been mostly pleasant, none the
less so, perhaps, that his ambition had required their concealment; he
felt he would rather have lived for sin, flagrant, even, and open,
than died like this. If he had known how near the end was he would not
have been so careful; the world’s opinion, bah! What was it worth now?
Something came to his mind that since the jar of the accident he had
strangely forgotten; something that had sent him there, sent him, as
it turned out, to his death. Was there justice in that? Curiously his
legally trained mind began to busy itself in weighing the equity of
the penalty. It was at least strangely swift, fitting and thorough,
but was it just? _Summum jus, summa injuria._ He smiled resentfully
at the aptness of the adage, then became conscious that some one was
speaking to him, was sympathetically asking as to his hurt. A young
man knelt by his side and, with a cushion, tried to make his position
more comfortable, talking cheerily to him the while. He was one of
the uninjured passengers doing his best for his less fortunate fellow
travellers. For the moment Gastineau hated his succourer in a wave of
malicious envy; why had not this nobody, this worthy, common-place
young Englishman, dull, probably, and mentally circumscribed, with the
hallmark of Eton plainly showing, why had not this man been shattered,
and he, the brilliant worker, with a name and a place in the world,
have gone scatheless? So bitter was the selfish thought that for a
while he could hardly bring himself to acknowledge the young stranger’s
kindness; all he wanted was to be let alone, to die quickly. But the
other was not to be easily rebuffed; perhaps he made allowance for a
sufferer’s state of mind and temper; anyhow he soon won, by tactful
assiduity, the wounded man’s gratitude, to such a degree, indeed,
that when they came to bear Gastineau to the monastery he begged the
young fellow not to leave him. There self came in again, since other
sufferers might need the young Samaritan’s care; but the case seemed
desperate, and he could not bear to refuse a manifestly dying man’s
request.

In such manner began the friendship between Paul Gastineau and Geoffrey
Herriard.

Now, within the next few days, chance, that had brought Gastineau
to this pass, continued a sequel which had a singular and important
bearing upon the future of the two men it had thrown together.
Gastineau, having been carried to the monastery and tended by the
monks, ever ready for such an office of mercy, lay for days in a
semi-comatose condition on the borderland between life and death. He
was but one of some dozen victims under the care of these good brothers
who, simple and practically dead to the world beyond their narrow
sphere, took little heed of their patients’ identities; they were to
them simply suffering men whose pain called forth their loving service.
Presently, to their joy and Herriard’s satisfaction, Gastineau, who had
seemed doomed, began to mend. He regained in a surprising degree his
mental faculties; the doctor shook his head at any idea of complete
recovery; he could never walk again, but, with care till the crisis was
well past, he would live. It was wonderful, wonderful, he declared;
not one man in a thousand would have survived such an injury, but the
vitality of the _Señor Inglese_ was the most marvellous he had ever
known; it was a revelation; and, after all, though most of us die when
we need not, there are some subjects whom it is absurdly difficult to
kill. But then look at him. Did one ever see such unmistakable power in
any one as this dark, resolute Englishman manifested? Were all mankind
built of that steel-like fibre physicians would be few. But to give
him the best chance it would be well to remove him to the air of the
mountains, and the sooner it was done the better.

Accordingly, early one morning, the patient, accompanied by Herriard,
was driven off on a journey of some half-dozen leagues to the
restorative atmosphere the doctor had suggested.

Now it happened that, an hour after their departure, death, as
though determined not to be twice baulked, struck his dart at one of
the patients who remained at the monastery, an Englishman also, a
stockbroker of travelling proclivities whose proposed itinerary had
scarcely included the River Styx. During the morning the reporter of
the local paper, who had, from the columns of a Madrid “contemporary,”
discovered that an Englishman of note was among the wounded (a fact
which he had totally failed to get wind of at first hand), bustled up
to the monastery with an eye to “copy” and the unusual importance of a
series of press telegrams to the capitals of Europe. Only to be told
that the Englishman had died that morning. Too disgusted at a lost
opportunity to enquire more closely as to the identity of the deceased,
he jumped to the conclusion that it was of course the eminent advocate
and distinguished member of the British Parliament who was dead, and
hurried off in sorrow to his office, formulating his dispatch by the
way. So it came to be flashed abroad that Paul Gastineau had, as
expected, succumbed to his injuries.

Herriard reading the news some days after was hot on contradicting it,
and greatly surprised when Gastineau forbade him to do so.

“Let it be,” he commanded. “It is scarcely a mistake. I am dead. Yes;
considering what my life has been, as really dead as many a man who is
in his grave. Let it be so, Herriard; give me your word that you will
not set the mistake right. I will tell you why presently.”

He was so evidently in earnest, that Herriard could not refuse to
pass his word, unaccountable as the request seemed. Yet, perhaps, to
him who, being a humble member of the same profession, knew well his
companion’s position and character therein, it was just conceivable
that this brilliant and ambitious man could not bear to swallow fate’s
nauseous dose in public. If we have to make a wry face we need not
stand in the market-place to do it.

So it came to pass that the report of Gastineau’s death was never
contradicted; he was supposed to have been buried in an obscure Spanish
grave; obituary notices appeared in the papers, and the very fact
that these were allowed to pass unchallenged practically confirmed
their truth. This business of a supposititious death would, however,
have been difficult to carry out successfully had it not been helped
by the circumstance that Gastineau stood, so far as family ties were
concerned, almost alone in the world. There was no near relative to go
out to Spain and make enquiries, even as a pious duty. Such distant
cousins as he had were poor, for he had raised himself; he had never
encouraged any advances they had attempted, and they accepted the news
of his death with little more interest than the rest of the world. So
when presently it appeared that he had left to his friend Geoffrey
Herriard a life interest in his property the relations had scarcely an
excuse for a grievance.

But when once the deception had been decided on, the busy, acute brain,
as keen as ever, set to work strenuously to perfect all the details
of the business. And something more. The hidden light was to burn as
brightly as ever behind its screen of lies; the dead hand was to strike
as viciously as of old, the stilled voice to sting through other lips.
Gastineau studied Herriard and came to the conclusion that he was
fitted for the purpose he had in mind. He could have done with a little
less honesty, but the scheme in its very character contained an element
which would neutralize that. Paul Gastineau was not going to play the
dead man in aught save in name. He was still a power. The sword with
which he had fought and gained so many encounters had snapped in his
hand, but he would do some savage execution yet with the jagged dagger
it had become. He was not going to lie still and impotently watch the
unchecked triumphs of the rivals and enemies he hated and despised. The
sole sharer of his secret was clever, ambitious, sick of waiting for
his chance, and, by Heaven, he should have it.

Accordingly he one day considerably startled Herriard by proposing to
him a scheme, extraordinary enough, yet of obvious feasibility. It was
simply this: That they should return to London secretly, and that he,
Gastineau, out of gratitude for the services rendered him, should repay
service for service by putting the whole of his great talents at his
young friend’s disposal to the furtherance of his career. Herriard, in
a word, was to be the mouthpiece of the stricken man’s brain. Gastineau
should be the dramatist and stage-manager, Herriard the actor, the
manifest form of the invisible spirit.

“I will make you, Geoffrey,” he protested, warming to kindle the
necessary enthusiasm in his intended pupil. “Your fortune at the
Bar, that will be child’s play; I will guarantee for you, if I live,
something higher, a prize more glorious than mere money. Don’t think
of that; leave money-grubbing to tradesmen; more than enough for
everything a man can want will come of course, for you cannot march
successfully through our profession without the accompaniment of the
golden cymbals! But if I take you in hand as I propose, there is no
saying where you will stop. Because I am at the end of my tether,
which has pulled me up with an ugly jerk, because I can do no more for
myself, is no reason why, so long as my brains are left me, I should
not do something for another man. No, don’t begin to thank me; I am not
even pretending that there is any virtue in my offer. If,” he laughed,
“I had still the use of my legs I wouldn’t do it, that’s obvious. I
should be too keen on my own career to trouble much about helping
another man on. I should, if I had completely recovered, have probably
given you a piece of jewellery in acknowledgment of your kindness,
and always been your friend and glad to see you. I am selfish; all
successful men are, although some contrive to disguise it from a stupid
public by advertising the contrary; it has made me; I don’t say I could
not have got on without practising selfishness, but it would have taken
me much longer, and time, you know, is of the essence of our contract
with Fate in these days of hustle, rush and scramble. And it is just
that very instinct of self that now draws me to you; for selfishness by
no means implies ingratitude. Within limits, they who make self their
god are keenly grateful to those who serve in his temple. It is just
as well to be honest in a matter of this kind, and for neither of us to
enter upon a contract such as I am proposing with false impressions.
For it must be a contract, my dear Geoffrey; binding by the very seal
of our individual interests, and to be honourably kept in its spirit as
well as on its material side. It will be necessary for us to believe
in one another, to trust one another. Those are general stipulations:
the only specific conditions I shall make are, absolute, inviolable
secrecy, which you would hardly break, and, what you may find less
easy to comply with, implicit obedience to my instructions. I am not
surprised to see you look serious at that, but don’t misunderstand
me. I am not going to put a knife in your hand and send you forth to
murder one of my pet aversions. I have no intention of asking you to do
anything, to use any weapon which an ordinary man of the world need in
honour, our code of to-day, shrink from. But if I want a man hit hard
you must hit him hard; you will be my soldier, and when I send you out
to fight I don’t expect you to patch up a truce and arbitrate. I have
always been a fighting man, and as my representative, my proxy, you
would have to carry my banner, which bears the motto, ‘No compromise.’
The rewards would be great. If, as I hardly suppose, my affairs should
turn out so that it became necessary for me to levy toll of your
earnings, I would take care you were no loser by that. I will get you
into the House, and what is more, I will make you master of the art of
making your mark there when you are in. That is the real crux. That is
where nine out of ten, even clever, men fail. There need be no limit to
your ambition. Every day’s programme shall be sketched for you, every
wrong turning marked with a red cross, every pitfall fenced, the right
road clearly marked. You shall see your fellow travellers drop off, but
you shall, if you follow my clue, go on triumphantly, each milestone
marking a new success. The world is before you to conquer. The world
consists mainly of fools, but even fools get in your way, it is all
they can do, and there are clever spirits to oppose your progress. The
conquest is easy enough, but unhappily men usually find that out too
late, when they are too old for the fray. I doubt whether you could do
it alone, Geoffrey, at least while the victory is worth having, but
with me behind you, you may be irresistible. Is it a compact?”

The compact was made readily enough, the chances of the strange
proposal being too dazzling to be rejected. If the purely ethical side
of the arrangement lodged a feeble protest in Herriard’s mind, the
material advantage with which it was weighted drove the monitor out of
hearing. Success deferred is to the impatience of youth more galling,
perhaps, than the settled disappointment of failure to a maturer mind.
From Herriard success, the immediate success which a fairly clever and
ambitious man expects to be his, had been withheld to a degree that
had begun to gall him. Other men of his standing, no cleverer but more
pushing, or more lucky, than he, were forging ahead. We are never so
conscious of our slow progress as when we see ourselves left behind by
others who started with us. Here, ready to Herriard’s hand, was a means
of catching up and passing his rivals, indeed of astonishing his world.
It seemed rather like making a compact with the devil, he would tell
himself with a laugh; yet where, he argued, was the wrong? He was going
to rob no one; it was merely a partnership that he was entering into,
and the success of a partnership is gauged by its strongest rather than
its weakest member. Why should a bed-ridden man of genius be debarred
from the active exercise of his mental powers? Where was the dishonour
in being his spokesman, any more than his amanuensis?

So the argument went all one way; the strange partnership began,
and was not long in justifying its existence. Men who frequented
the fruitful and thorny paths of the law began to speak of Geoffrey
Herriard as one of the cleverest of rising counsel; some, speculating
in “futures” out of the capital of their reputation for foresight,
pointed at him as the coming man. He went far to justify them by the
lucky capture of a seat at a bye-election, the victory being in some
measure due to a series of particularly smart and telling speeches,
which tore into shreds the platform of his opponent, a flabby
soap-maker with a long purse and a short vocabulary. Herriard’s maiden
speech was a success. “Best I’ve heard since poor Paul Gastineau,” Sir
Henry Hartfield commented.

“Rather reminds me of him,” his companion remarked. “Something of the
same fiery periods and tendency to antithesis. It just shows how easily
a man’s place can be filled, even the cleverest.”

The resemblance in style was indeed remarkable both at the Bar, on
the platform, and in the House, for in the early day of his pupildom
Herriard had to keep tight and assiduous hold on his master’s hand. The
work was hard, but the tutor was clever in imparting his knack, and,
with a reputation increasing to a flattering degree, the incentive to
industry on the pupil’s part was great.

Every night Herriard paid a visit to the secluded house in Mayfair,
sometimes to stay far into the early hours of the morning, rehearsing
a speech, analyzing the probable trends of a cross-examination, making
notes from Gastineau’s quick observation of weak points or strong
ones, spotting flaws, devising traps, in fact looking to every rivet
in his own armour, speculating on every possible loose joint in his
adversaries’ for the morrow’s tilt.

So the singular conjunction of rare master and apt pupil had continued
in almost unbroken success for more than three years. Herriard
had gained such a degree of confidence in playing his part as now
almost to wear his instructor’s talent at second-hand. He promised
to become a rich man, and Gastineau, with ample means of his own
for his circumscribed luxury, was pleased that it should be so. In
return for wealth and reputation he expected Herriard to mark down,
to follow up and worry certain old-time rivals of his own. His pupil
sometimes marvelled at the malignant viciousness of his “riding
orders.” It was as though Gastineau had given him a rhetorical bottle
of vitriol to fling over the smug face of some self-satisfied prig
of an Under Secretary. Still he felt in honour bound to fling the
corrosive denunciations with the most stinging effect, very much to the
distortion of the Superior Being’s cultivated blandness. Then Gastineau
was wont to declare himself well satisfied; and perfect friendship,
founded on mutual service, existed between the two men.

But strange events, little dreamt of by either, were on their way to
meet them; events which were to turn into disastrous twistings the
paths that had run so easily side by side.




CHAPTER III

A SOCIETY SENSATION


“Have you heard the latest sensation, Lady Rotherfield?”

“Oh, no, Mr. Greetland. Do tell me. It’s not the scandal about Lord
Barnoldby and Infanta Turnour? Of course every one knows all about
that.”

“Hardly all, dear lady,” Greetland simpered. He was one of the
cohort of smart diners-out; the social bagmen who all travel in the
same commodity, for which there is universal demand--scandal. “The
Barnoldby-Turnour affair is never-ending. Nobody ever will hear the
last of that.”

“The Infanta is old enough to know better,” observed Mrs. Hargrave on
the other side of him, scandalized but interested.

“She is big enough at any rate,” Greetland smirked.

“To be ashamed of herself,” supplemented Lady Rotherfield illogically.

“Perhaps she has out-grown the sense of shame,” suggested Greetland,
whose stature matched his ambition. “But that wasn’t what I was
referring to. Something much more thrilling.”

“Mr. Greetland!”

The society purveyor glanced round to see whether he had an audience
worthy of the news. People on each side seemed to be pricking up
their ears. There was evidently something of interest going forward;
the spasmodic tea-table talk languished; Dormer Greetland was always
interesting; even men who itched to kick him admitted that. “A
curiously marked caterpillar” had once been Gastineau’s correction when
some one spoke of Greetland as a worm. He was too sleek and foppish to
be a human exemplar of the more coarse and naked invertebrate.

A pretty piece of scandal was evidently forthcoming, and he got an
audience to his liking--almost every one of importance in the room,
with one notable exception, the hostess, Countess Alexia von Rohnburg,
who was listening to a prosy Russian diplomat.

“What is it? You have some news for us, Greetland?” cried the
high-pitched voice of Baron de Daun, as he came across the floor
and stood over the group. In his way the Baron was as great a
scandal-monger and _blagueur_ as the other man, but he tore reputations
to shreds with greater violence than his English _confrère_, who was,
after all, more of an artist. On the other hand, the Baron had greater
justification in peeping through the chinks in society’s shutters, for
was he not a diplomatist?

“A very extraordinary thing has come to light,” Greetland said, with
an air befitting the communication. “It is really quite dramatic, and
Heaven only knows what will be the end of it.”

“What? What?” Baron de Daun’s temper was impatient of preliminaries, a
circumstance which, however, was not so great a drawback as it would
seem in his profession, where due weight is given to considerations
other than individual fitness.

“You remember,” Greetland proceeded, still deliberately--on his own
ground it took more than the representative of a second-rate power to
flurry him--“you remember the affair of poor Beauty Martindale?”

“Oh, yes; the poor fellow who died so tragically at the ball at--where
was it? Yes?”

To Lady Rotherfield details were unimportant; but to Greetland they had
their value. “Vaux House,” he supplied.

“Yes? yes?”

“Let’s see. He was supposed to have died of heart disease, but it was
doubted----”

“There was no doubt about it,” de Daun asserted quickly. The subject
was too interesting for more diplomatic contradiction.

“Of course,” corroborated Sir Perrott Aspall, who had been in
Australia at the time and was consequently well qualified to give an
authoritative dictum. “He was murdered, done to death by one of his
partners, eh? That’s the idea.”

“I recollect,” put in Mrs. Hargrave breathlessly. “Half the smart women
in town were suspected.”

“Many of whom were not at the dance,” de Daun laughed.

“It’s years ago,” Lady Rotherfield said, as an excuse for general
vagueness.

“Well, what of it? What has come to light?” the Baron demanded. “Get
on, my dear fellow, if you have anything to tell us.”

Greetland, master of the situation, was content to wait till the
chatter stopped. “The facts were these. Reggie Martindale, the
handsomest man in town, was found dead at the Lancashires’ dance.
You are quite right, dear lady, it was at first supposed and given
out that it was heart disease. Then, almost by accident, and after
the certificate had been given, a tiny wound, scarcely bigger than a
pin-prick, was found in his left side near the heart. That was hushed
up; luckily the Lancashires’ medico, who found it out, happened to
be Martindale’s as well, and so had the matter in his own hands; and
naturally the Duchess did not want a scandal. It was said that Dr.
Blaydon handed the Duke three-eights of an inch of broken steel which
he had found imbedded in poor Beauty’s heart, and received in return a
cheque which established a record price for the metal. But old Blaydon
knew himself to be a dying man at the time; an _exposé_ could hardly
hurt him, and he had a large family to provide for. As a matter of fact
he died a few months afterwards, to the dear Duchess’s great content.
It’s extraordinary how fussy some good people can be over the idea of a
scandal.”

“You see,” observed Mrs. Hargrave, “the Duchess does not require
advertisement for herself or her dances.”

“If it had been that terrible Oglander woman, now, she would have
paid the doctor to call in the Coroner, and sent out invitations for
the inquest, with reserved seats and champagne for the Press.” Lady
Rotherfield never missed an opportunity, even when she was in a hurry,
of girding at her especial abomination among the many parvenues who
beset her path.

“Well? well?” Baron de Daun’s sharp voice split the air like the crack
of a whip. “And now, after all, the affair has come out, eh?”

“Something more than that,” Greetland returned, with all the
superiority of the man who knows. “A good many people knew that much
already. You see, after Blaydon’s death, when she felt they were safe,
the dear Duchess allowed herself to be a little indiscreet, of course
only in her own set.” His tone included himself by implication in the
select band who shared the ducal secret. De Daun saw it was no use
trying to hurry him, and worked off his impatience by pulling viciously
at his moustache.

“What I am going to tell you,” Greetland proceeded, “happened only a
day or two ago. They were doing something to the little room where
Beauty was found dead, just off the ball-room, putting up new cornices
or something--not before they were wanted, they say the curtains at
Vaux House were hung in Queen Anne’s time; probably the poles date from
the Conquest--well, in pulling the old window trappings about, the men
found a long jewelled hair-pin, a tiny sword, the hilt set in diamonds
and with the point broken off.”

“By Jove!” exclaimed Sir Perrott.

“They found this in the cornice?” de Daun asked intently. It was
important for him to get the story correctly.

“Somewhere stuck away in the curtains or behind the shutter; anyhow,
hidden by the window.”

“And who found it? A workman, eh?”

“One of the Duke’s men.”

“And what is to be the upshot?” Mrs. Hargrave’s turn of mind was
practical and anticipatory.

“Well, the whole thing will come out,” Greetland asserted.

“No? Be made public?” Lady Rotherfield was dead against the publicity
of to-day. A scandal to which the mob had access lost all its piquancy
and was not worth discussing. The world was becoming less interesting
every hour.

“To-morrow,” Greetland confidently affirmed, “the man in the street
will know as much of the affair as we do.”

Lady Rotherfield gave a shrug of despair. The world where the man in
the street is as well posted as the Duchess in the Square was scarcely
worth living in.

“Then the Duke can’t hush it up this time, eh?” de Daun demanded,
showing his malicious teeth.

“No,” Greetland purred on. “He is in an awful way about it, and the
Duchess is having a bad time.”

“Poor woman!” cried Mrs. Hargrave with cynical sympathy.

“Well, it is all her fault, so Lady Helen says,” the Society Newsman
went on, as suavely as though he were referring to no greater tragedy
than a failure on the Matrimonial Exchange. “The dear Duchess would
dismiss one of her carriage footmen because he was three-quarters of an
inch shorter than his fellow. Lady Helen’s maid tells her that the man
wore cork wedges in his boots till he could hardly keep his balance,
and was quite willing to meet her views and obliging, but the other
day he had to go out unexpectedly, and in his hurry forgot the corks;
the Duchess’s eagle eye caught the disparity, her artistic sense was
outraged, and the poor Duke had to give the man notice. She said that
so long as Nature continued occasionally to turn out human beings six
feet two inches in height she would not put up with a trumped-up,
inferior article, only six feet one, of which a quarter only was
genuine flesh and blood and the rest cork, and who looked as though
liable to fall on his nose. Men of her standard height were to be had,
and she meant to have them, all through alike; the cork-tipped variety
she would leave to Bishop’s wives, dowager Countesses, and other
latitudinarians.”

“So like the dear Duchess,” Lady Rotherfield laughed. “Poor Duke, what
could he say?”

“There was only one thing he could say to the man. Well, the fellow
resented his dismissal, which was rather absurd of him.”

“He ought to have been thankful to get rid of the corks,” was Sir
Perrott’s opinion.

“Instead of which he appears to have declared that the proper thing
for the Duchess to have done was to have sacked his tall colleague
and replaced him by a man to match himself, minus the corks. This
was flat treason in the face of the fact that the standard height of
the Lancashires’ carriage footmen was settled for all time in the
second year of the reign of William and Mary. When the _lèse-majesté_
was repeated to the Duchess she became livid. The sacredness of the
Lancashire traditions to be scoffed at by a cork-mounted flunkey!
Should the ducal glory be belittled by a creature whose only claim for
notice rested upon a pair of false heels? The consequence was that the
wretched man was told to go on the spot, and that happened just after
the discovery of the compromising hair-pin.”

“Oh, I see,” said Sir Perrott.

“The man thought he would get what he could out of the ducal _ménage_,
and went straight off with his secret to Hepplethwaite. Hepplethwaite
gave him twenty pounds for it, and resold it within the hour to the
Duke for a hundred and an invitation for his wife to the next reception
at Vaux House.”

“I must remember not to go,” Lady Rotherfield murmured. “That odious
pushing woman tries to work her way everywhere.”

“It would have been a grand _coup_ for the Hepplethwaite group of
papers,” Greetland said; “and would have set up their circulation
phenomenally, but Hepplethwaite wants something more than money now.
The Brailsfords of the _Daily Comet_ somehow succeeded in dining
at Montford House last week. Montford wants advertisement for that
ass of a son of his, Darsingham, who is by way of taking up the New
Hibernian question in the House to keep him out of mischief; and so the
Hepplethwaites were bound to go one better.”

“They say,” observed Mrs. Hargrave, “that Hepplethwaite and Brailsford
were office boys together in a tea warehouse.”

“And,” put in Sir Perrott, “they are now running it neck and neck for a
Peerage.”

“Shocking!” Lady Rotherfield groaned.

“Then the Vaux House affair is not to be public property at all?” de
Daun asked. So long as he could add it to his _dossier_ the stock of
public knowledge might just as well be the poorer by that pungent
scandal.

“Won’t it come out, though?” Greetland returned. “I haven’t finished
my story. The footman on finding that the news did not appear in the
Hepplethwaite rags took it to Brailsford, got fifteen pounds for
it this time; and it is going to burst upon a jaded reading public
to-morrow morning. They were to have had it to-day, only special-sized
type had to be cast, and they were not ready.”

“What is this thrilling announcement which is being prepared for us,
Mr. Greetland?”

The tatler looked up with almost a start. The question had been put
by Countess Alexia von Rohnburg, their young hostess, who had joined
the group, unnoticed by Greetland or his listeners, intent as they
were upon the new sensation. The Russian proser had come to a pause in
that flow of shallow talk with which diplomatists are wont to disguise
their thoughts and to cover the watchful observation of their fellows,
and the Countess, who had caught above the suave murmur a word or
two in de Daun’s high-pitched voice that had arrested her, had risen
and crossed the room. There was nothing in her handsome, animated
face, the index of a susceptive mind, that showed more than an almost
languid curiosity, as of one who lived in an atmosphere filled with
tales concerning the great names of the day, and whose appetite was
slightly blunted by the familiar fare. Nevertheless Greetland, the most
studiously composed man of his world, looked up with an expression of
greater embarrassment than he often permitted himself. And it was de
Daun, not he, who answered the question.

“Mr. Greetland was telling us of the discovery of a hair ornament, a
small jewelled dagger with the point broken off, in the room at Vaux
House where Captain Martindale met his death two years ago.”

“Ah! How thrilling!” If the speaker were really thrilled the mobile
face must surely have indicated it more vividly. A wave of interest
passed across it; the dark curves of the eyebrows rose and fell, that
was all. Dormer Greetland, watching the face intently for a man in
whose social balance-sheet manners stood as a notable asset, saw no
more.

“Is it quite true, Mr. Greetland?” The tone implied an amount of
incredulity which compelled a spirited justification.

“Absolutely, Countess. I was just saying that the discovery will be in
the papers to-morrow.”

His questioner smiled. “Does that make it true?”

“It will at least bring the story to its proof. The Duchess won’t let
it pass if it is a canard: she doesn’t need advertisement. But I happen
to know it is quite true.”

“I am sure Mr. Greetland would rather be dull than unauthentic, as the
lesser of the two crimes.” The sarcasm was none the less stinging from
being shot through the sweetest of smiles.

“The Duke has been trying to hush it up,” Lady Rotherfield put in.

Countess Alexia laughed. “All the details complete. And of course the
owner of the sword has been found.”

“I think not,” said Greetland.

“Probably the Duke knows, as he was so anxious to hush up the affair,”
the Countess continued, in her fascinating banter. “Poor Duke, he had
better be careful, or he will be arrested as what you call an accessory
after the fact, which would be a sensation, if you like. Always
supposing, that is, that poor Reggie Martindale did not die of heart
disease.”

“That has been clearly proved, Countess,” Greetland said, glad of one
firm foothold in stemming the increasing flow of increduilty.

Alexia gave a shrug. “I never heard it, and I’m afraid I hear most
things.”

“The Duke hushed that up,” explained Sir Perrott.

“How clever of him! With that talent for hushing tiresome tongues what
a perfect nursemaid he might have been if he hadn’t been born a Duke
and a man. How lucky he has failed this time, or we should not be
having the sensation of the jewelled dagger, the false lover and the
fair assassin. What hard lines! What a warning to inconstant young men
and fussy Dukes. And we are to see it all in print to-morrow?”

“Get the _Daily Comet_ for choice, Countess,” de Daun grinned.

“I will, indeed. I am so sorry for the poor Duke.”

“And the lady, the owner of the tell-tale weapon?” Greetland suggested.

“Ah, yes. But it is so long ago. Our sympathy by this time is probably
superfluous. Our tragedies to-day are almost as short-lived as our
comedies.”

“And almost as amusing.”

“Much more, to the spectators. Having left the art of pure comedy
behind us with the days of patches and powder and red heels, we have
taken a lesson from our stage managers and learnt to turn a tiresome
tragedy into a roaring farce. It is easy enough. Play with a light
touch, and exaggerate the sentiment, that’s the way to get your laughs
and your audience; the world must be amused at any cost. Oh, Prosper”;
she broke off, and called to her brother, Count Prosper von Rohnburg,
who had just come in with a scientific-looking man, “have you heard
anything of the wonderful tale Mr. Greetland has been telling us, how
they have found at Vaux House the weapon with which that poor Captain
Martindale is supposed to have been killed? Isn’t it thrilling?”

“No,” he answered, speaking with a foreign accent far more pronounced
than his sister’s. “I am behind the world to-day. There was no time to
go to the Clubs, we have been absurdly busy at the Embassy. Here, Alix,
let me present to you Doctor Hallamar who has come to spend a little
time in England.”

Doctor Hallamar bent his leonine head with its mass of obstreperous
hair low till his lips touched the Countess’s hand. Manifestly he was
a man of power, the keen, resolute face was of the kind that makes one
glad to think its indicative strength has taken up arms against our
common enemy, disease.

“You are taking a holiday in England, Doctor,” Alexia enquired.

“Hardly.” The deep tones sounded in unison with the rest of the man’s
heroic fibre. “My visit is professional primarily, but I hope to see
something of England during my enforced stay; if not of its scenery, at
least of its scientific side.”

“Doctor Hallamar means the hospitals,” the Count laughed. “He would
rather see an interesting operation than the finest view in the world.
You know the Doctor is the only man in Europe who can cure a certain
form of disease.”

Hallamar smiled deprecatingly. “Let us say, treat it, Count. I fear I
cannot often undertake to cure it.”

“Oh, you are modest, Doctor,” Alexia laughed. “And you have come over
to attend a special case?”

Hallamar bowed assent. “A lady who has lost the use of her limbs
through an accident. As a diplomatist’s sister, Countess, you will not
expect me to say more.” He beamed inscrutably through his spectacles.
“My mission may be a failure, and then the less we shall have said
about it the better.”

“I can’t imagine you a failure, Doctor,” Alexia said, and truly, as her
eyes rested with admiration on the strong, resourceful face.

Hallamar’s smile had a touch of regret now.

“I would, Countess, that your gracious words did not carry with them
to me the sting of unintended satire.”

“What is all this about the discovery at Vaux House?” Count Prosper
asked.

“Oh, we are to have the whole account to-morrow in the papers,” his
sister replied. “We can scarcely trouble Mr. Greetland to go over the
story again.”

The Mayfair newsman seemed not disinclined to repeat the recitation
to a, perhaps, more appreciative listener; but the Count, accustomed
to take his sister’s slightest hint, abandoned any further show of
curiosity. But he said presently, “We were at that ball at Vaux House,
weren’t we, Alix? Yes; I recollect poor Martindale. Good-looking fellow
he was.”

“You remember the sensation his death caused,” Sir Perrott said. “Half
the smart women in town, married and single, were supposed to be hit by
it.”

Doctor Hallamar’s smile had faded. He was not interested and he showed
it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Baron de Daun and Dormer Greetland rose to go at the same time.
Greetland’s adieux were the more lengthy; he had so many social loose
ends to tie up. It seemed when he reached the hall that de Daun must
have been waiting for him. They went out together.

“Serious thing this about Vaux House,” the Baron remarked, in quite
a concerned voice. “I say, Greetland, between ourselves, was the
Countess,” he gave a jerk of the head in the direction of the house
they had just left, “one of the women talked of with Martindale?”

“I fancy she was,” the other answered, looking straight in front of
him.

Tatler as he was, he knew de Daun, and did not care to be pumped to
serve the thirst of that blatant young diplomat.

“It seemed rather curious, to say the least of it,” his companion
persisted, “her affecting to doubt the truth of the story. I wonder if
the sword hair-pin was hers.”

He looked round at Greetland with the quick turn of a bird of prey.

“Oh, that’s going too far,” Greetland cried, throwing up his hand half
way in protest, then full length to hail a passing hansom.




CHAPTER IV

THE DUCAL POINT OF VIEW


The _Daily Comet_ came out next day with its threatened sensational
blazon: the world of London and beyond greedily assimilated the
startling tale, and their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Lancashire
began to have an exceedingly unpleasant time of it. The Duke
especially; since he had the Duchess, as well as the Press and the
rest of the world, to encounter. He had done nothing wrong (with the
exception of that bribe to the late Dr. Blaydon) or even foolish, he
told himself, for his little arrangement with the doctor had been
highly expedient; yet the affair had, by the merest chance, taken this
unfortunate turn, and he suddenly found his ducal neck and wrists in
a moral pillory, with a shower of rotten eggs unpleasantly imminent.
Under the circumstances he judged it wise to confine his perambulations
within the precincts of Vaux House; happily its grounds were extensive,
and for the first time in his life as he dispiritedly paced them, he
omitted to regret the waste they represented of colossally remunerative
building sites. He simply dared not show his face in the streets--not
even the streets that he owned--and as to going into one of his clubs,
including the House of Lords, why, he would as soon have walked into
the crater of Vesuvius. So he promenaded up and down and around the
somewhat dingy gardens of which the sombre and blighted tone was
in complete harmony with his feelings. He could hear passers-by
talking on the other side of the high wall which secluded his august
pleasure-ground from the vulgar world, and wondered if, nay, made
sure, they were discussing him and his methods in a spirit of galling
irreverence, if they took their tone from that of the more enterprising
journals he had read. Yes; it was an uncomfortable position for any
one, let alone an old-established Duke; he became sure certain people
were watching him from such upper windows as commanded a view of the
grounds, since the wall of even an exclusive Duke is subject to certain
architectural limitations; and he went indoors. On his way he saw
people looking curiously through the great iron gates at the house of
mystery and crime. He fancied he heard a murmur as he crossed their
sight, but that was probably a symptom of hypertrophied egoism. In his
perturbation of mind he flung himself into a room which he had intended
to avoid, and found himself alone with the Duchess.

There was something in her eye which forbade retreat.

“Well?” The monosyllable was a challenge: more, it was the first flick
of a castigation.

The Duke merely gave a shrug which was the most non-committal answer
that occurred to him.

“What is the latest?” the Duchess demanded, in a tone which was not to
be trifled with.

“I have heard nothing, dear. I have not been out.”

“I just saw you come in.”

“From the garden.”

“Why don’t you go out?”

The Duke made a stand. “I don’t care to, while this wretched business
is in big letters at every corner.”

“What is that to us? You should be above taking notice of these
halfpenny rags. If you are afraid of walking on the pavements, have a
brougham and drive down to the Carlton. You ought to hear what people
are saying.”

“I am,” returned the Duke, with infinite sense, “the last person in
town to hear what people are really saying.”

“You can go and tell them what you think about the whole disgusting
business,” said the Duchess.

“I’m hanged if I do,” the Duke returned. “If they have any sense they
can guess that.”

“Pray what do you expect then I am going to do?” the Duchess demanded.

The Duke intimated by a shrug that he had formed no definite
anticipations as to his consort’s line of conduct.

“If you were not a fool,” she said, “you would know that people haven’t
any sense. They just accept any ideas that may be given them.”

“Well, I’m not going to run about town giving people ideas,” the Duke
declared sullenly.

“You know best how far you are justified in coming to that decision,”
the Duchess returned, with a world of meaning behind the mere
inoffensive words. “Then you mean to let these abominable papers have
it all their own way?”

“I don’t care.”

“But you ought to care.” Her Grace’s temper was rising. “You have no
business to be a Duke. You are a disgrace to your order. You’ll get a
wigging, my dear boy, when the King hears of it. Don’t expect me to
come to the rescue, that’s all. If you don’t face it out, I shall have
to leave town in the height of the season, and I won’t leave town, so
there!”

“Leave town, Isabel? What in the name of common sense have we done that
we should run away?” The Duke was getting exasperated.

“We?” screamed the Duchess. “What have you done? To take trouble and
spend money in hushing a thing up, and then to allow it to come out, at
a particularly awkward time, too, is the method of an imbecile.”

Like most stupid persons the Duke was sensitive on the subject of
_nous_, and the Duchess knew it.

“Imbecile?” he echoed huskily. “I was clever enough for you to marry.”

“You were clever enough to marry me, if you like,” she returned, with a
puff of scorn.

“Clever!” he repeated in turn, in as withering a voice as he could
command. “The general opinion at the time, pretty freely expressed, was
that I was a fool.”

“General opinion!” she returned with infinite contempt. “The opinion
of a lot of women who were mad to be duchesses. What is your general
opinion worth to-day in this tiresome affair? As worthless and wrong as
usual. No, John, you did a good thing for yourself when you married me,
and you know it.”

“I know it?”

“I have made you.”

This was too much. Here was the once Miss Isabel Grendon, a nobody with
a pretty face and trim figure to whom he had, after much hesitation,
played Cophetua, talking of having made a Duke of eight generations.
“Made me!” he cried thickly, in his ducal indignation. “I had an idea
that the Dukes of Lancashire were made, as you call it, some hundreds
of years before your name appeared on the roll.”

“Made? Yes, I dare say; after a fashion. But you were not worth
noticing, even when you had got your coronets on. Before I took you in
hand you were nobodies.”

“Nobodies!” the Duke could only echo. In this rarified atmosphere of
insult independent argument, and even utterance, were asphyxiated.

“Nobodies,” the Duchess maintained with exasperating insistence. “I’ve
seen your mother waiting in Johnson and Maxtons to be served and none
of the shop people would notice her. They knew well enough who she was,
and that she had come in to spend half an hour in buying a few yards
of sevenpence-halfpenny lace to furbish up an old gown which her own
housekeeper wouldn’t have looked at except to sell to the dustman to
dress his wife in for Hampstead Heath. _J’ai changé tout cela._”

“Yes, you have,” assented the Duke, recovering his breath as his wife
lost hers. “And if extravagance makes a man, you have made me.”

“One owes something to one’s position,” argued the lady.

“You owe a great deal, my dear, not to say everything,” retorted the
Duke, in a happy flash.

“To be Duchess of Lancashire meant next to nothing before my day,” her
Grace proceeded, ignoring the hit. “I saw the possibilities of the
position.”

“No doubt,” agreed the Duke.

“And have raised it to its proper level in accordance with modern
ideas. I found you thrown away in a dusthole, I have polished you up
and brought you into the drawing-room.”

“Have you indeed? Very obliging of you,” was all the Duke could say.

“You think,” went on the Duchess, having got again out of the
tanglewood into a straight run, “you think that a Duke can go about
like an old-clothes man, and his Duchess like a laundress, and be
respected. That shows what a fool you are, John. You imagine in your
stupidity that people in our position can defy appearances and do just
as we like. So we can; but the world very soon takes care to show us
that if we like to drop out it won’t detain us. To-day the world thinks
exactly as much of us as we show it we think of ourselves. It was all
very well while the Feudal System lingered, and there was no moneyed
mob to challenge us. In these days of shallow pretension and surface
estimation a Duke in a bad hat is thought less of than a bookmaker
in a good one; a dowdy Duchess cannot hold her own against a smart
milliner. The world to-day does not bother itself to think who you are,
and what your ancestors have been and done, in short what that bad hat
really covers; it wants you to show unmistakably that you spend your
money--or other peoples’--and add to the general amusement. Everything
is theatrical nowadays, all glitter and show, and the crowd does not
ask itself what the gorgeous scenery looks like from the back. It is
as though people preferred a highly coloured landscape in the theatre,
just canvas, distemper and limelight, to the real thing on one of our
estates. Yes, John, you are a fool not to see what I’ve done for you
and your House.”

The Duke accepted the long lecture, not because it convinced him
or uprooted his belief in the infallibility of his family ways, but
because he was given no chance of interrupting it. When it had come to
an end, he said, not unnaturally, “I don’t quite see what all this has
to do with the present business. What are we going to do?”

“I have told you,” insisted the Duchess. “Go down to the clubs and face
it out.”

“I’m damned if I do,” said the Duke, exasperated to find his patience
had gained him nothing.

“If you are going to be vulgar----” began the Duchess.

“I’m not going down to the clubs,” he maintained.

“You’ve got to go, John, and the sooner the better.”

“I tell you I won’t!”

“You prefer to skulk here?”

“If it hadn’t been for your unreasonable folly about that wretched
footman----” he began.

“I’m not going to be seen with footmen that don’t match for you or
anybody. You’ll be expecting me next to wear odd gloves or shoes or
stockings.”

The Duke was relieved from trying for a reply to this unanswerable
argument by a knock at the door.

“Mr. Playford is in the blue drawing-room, your Grace.”

The Duke glanced rather helplessly at his wife.

“Show Mr. Playford here,” she said to the man, with decision. “Now we
shall hear something of what is being said in the world outside, which
you haven’t the pluck to face. Aubrey Playford knows everything.”

Next moment the omniscient one was shaking hands with them, and
wondering curiously what sort of a _tête-á-tête_ he had interrupted.
As the Duchess was so smiling and the Duke so obviously relieved, he
concluded that he had broken up a row.

“Isn’t it too disgustingly provoking, this fuss about that tiresome
affair!” the Duchess said, as soon as they had settled down. “These
wretched cheap papers.”

“Oh, they must have a sensation,” Playford answered, politely
sympathetic. “One comfort is that nobody believes half they read in
them.”

No one could be better aware than Aubrey Playford of the falseness of
that statement. No one knew better than he, a keen observer of his
kind, that people are only too greedy to take in everything, without
discount, that can be said or printed to their neighbour’s obloquy,
or disadvantage, and more particularly when that neighbour happens
to hold a high position. Under some conditions Playford would have
been spiteful enough to say so, and indulge in a half-hour of moral
vivisection; but that was not his cue nor his purpose to-day.

“It is altogether most provoking,” the Duchess declared. “What are they
saying about it, Aubrey? I don’t mean the wretched papers, but at the
clubs?”

Playford gave a shrug. “What do they ever say at the clubs beyond what
some one tells them to say?” he replied, with a cynical contempt that,
coming to him so easily, seemed a characteristic. “I haven’t heard
much. Piersfield was full of it, as he would be, but more in the way
of collecting than distributing, and, of course, little Roddy Arden
was making the most of a new sensation. By the way, it was pretty well
known yesterday among what I call the professionals, Dormer Greetland
and his school, and they naturally made the most of their twenty-four
hours’ start with the news.”

The Duke groaned. “All through a wretched footman. It is terrible to
think how mean an instrument it takes to set the world agog and to
bring us into unpleasant notoriety.”

“Oh, it is nothing,” said his visitor in a tone between sympathy and
indifference. “I certainly should not worry about it if I were you. It
won’t be even a nine days’ wonder. The Rullington case comes on next
Monday; there will be some pretty disclosures for the mob in that,
and I hear that Lady Rullington has her trunks ready packed, and is
prepared to skip.”

The Duchess raised her eyebrows. “As bad as that? It is a pity that a
presumably sensible woman as Maud Rullington was at one time should
have such a vague idea as to where to draw the line.”

The Duke breathed heavily through his set teeth. “These liftings of the
curtain for the benefit of the mob are very damaging and regrettable.”

“They are,” Playford agreed. “And the man in the street is getting
every day more eager for a peep.”

“The man in the street,” said the Duke, the phrase bringing to his mind
an unpleasant reminiscence, “has been waiting outside my gates all day
for a peep. I don’t know what we are coming to when our very privacy is
invaded.”

“It is a sign of these times of undesirable publicity,” Playford
answered, almost with a yawn. He had not come there to listen to his
Grace’s platitudinous complaints, and was awaiting his opportunity for
something else. As for the Lancashires, why, who can bring himself to
sympathize with a Duke and Duchess in their social embarrassments?
Are they not considered to stand too high on their pedestals for the
sympathy of the crowd below to reach them, and to deserve any little
exposure which their exalted position invites? At any rate, they were
just now but the king and queen of Aubrey Playford’s chess-board.

“I don’t think you need fear any pointing of scandal’s finger at you,”
he observed, with a confidence-imparting smile. “The question which
will be agitating everybody’s mind, when once they have arrived at the
real bearings of the business, will be, who was the lady?”

“Ah, yes,” exclaimed the Duke, somewhat relieved.

“But, Aubrey,” the Duchess protested, “we are as much in the dark there
as anybody else.”

Playford’s dark eyes looked hungrily shrewd. “You have no idea,
Duchess?” he asked, with a touch of incredulity.

“Not the remotest,” she replied.

“I wish we had,” chimed in the Duke, and then fell to wondering vaguely
exactly what he would do with the information if he had it.

The Duchess had her eyes fixed on her visitor’s shrewd face. “You know,
Aubrey?” she demanded, with a look of conviction.

Playford’s astute smile broadened as he shook his head. “Not I,
Duchess. But I might perhaps give a guess for what it is worth.”

“Let’s have it,” cried the Duke, all attention.

Playford looked inscrutable. “It is dangerous work guessing,” he
returned, “unless one has something to go upon. I was only suggesting
it that the hounds of scandal may prefer to follow that fox to this if
there should be a cross-scent.”

“Quite so,” the Duke agreed, none the less confidently that the idea
had never occurred to him.

The Duchess was reflecting. “We have not much to go upon,” she said
slowly. “It was so long ago.”

“You have,” suggested Playford, “the ornament, the diamond hair-pin,
was it not, that the man found?”

“Ah, yes.” She turned to him with alert scrutiny.

“That won’t be claimed,” said the Duke, with a short laugh.

“Claimed! How stupid you are, John!” Her impatient exclamation scarcely
took her eyes from Playford’s face.

“It will probably be claimed by Scotland Yard,” remarked that gentleman
with easy premonition. “I am surprised they have not been here yet. I
see, though, they say they have no knowledge of the affair. So like
them. Perhaps they expected to be sent for. May I see the thing before
it goes?”

“The ornament?” The Duke glanced at his wife in some hesitation. She
had taken the tiresome thing and locked it up, being in no mood to
pander to an already more than objectionable curiosity. He waited to
see how she would refuse, but she rose, and saying, “I will get it,”
left the room.

“The Duchess is not going to show it to everybody,” said the Duke, with
a, possibly manneristic, touch of patronage.

“No, I shouldn’t,” Playford commented, with a shrewd smile. He thought
he knew why he was made the exception, and was not going to take is as
a favour.

His manner, with men at least, Dukes included, was rather more brusque
than his present host liked, so no word further was spoken till the
Duchess returned.

“Here it is,” she said, and unwrapped the tissue paper from the
unhappy piece of evidence. There it was. A miniature sword, the blade
tarnished gold, the hilt set with diamonds, and the point broken off.

Playford watched its uncovering eagerly. As it was disclosed he put out
his hand to take it, and, as he did so, glanced up in the Duchess’s
face. He did not mean to tell her anything, yet she saw in his eyes
something that said a good deal. Next moment he had turned away to the
light and was scrutinizing the little sword closely, eagerly, as a man
will who wants to carry in his mind the exact image of an object he may
not see again.

The Duke and Duchess stood behind him in expectant silence. But they
both looked rather blank when he at length turned to them and affected
to be studying a stain of rust on the blade.

“That looks as though it might have been blood,” he said, tapping it
with his finger nail.

“Hah: do you think so?” returned the Duke in a non-committal tone.

“Shouldn’t be surprised,” Playford replied in an abominably
disappointing way. “But I’m not an analyst.”

“Do you recognize the sword, Aubrey?” asked the Duchess, with
manifestly restrained impatience.

Playford looked at her with a fine assumption of surprise. “No. Why?
Ought I to?” he asked. “Do you know the owner?”

“I thought you did,” she returned pointedly.

He handed it back with a laugh. “Not I. It is not an uncommon device.
I fancy even Scotland Yard will have some trouble in following up that
clue. Thanks for letting me see it, Duchess. I’m afraid I have rather a
taste for the morbid.”

She was evidently not going to get anything out of him that would pay
for the trouble of fetching the _corpus delicti_, and so her Grace
wrapped it up again in no very amiable mood. Her visitor’s reticence
was the more exasperating in that her instinct told her he could, if he
chose, give a shrewd guess at the owner. Except as a matter of feminine
curiosity she did not care much to know what she was convinced Playford
might have told her; but she did not consider it consistent with her
dignity to be thus made use of, and she felt very much inclined to be
rude to her departing guest. And it is given to Duchesses to be very
rude when they like. Then a certain idea of the inexpediency of venting
her spleen occurred to her just in time; perhaps she realized that
Aubrey Playford was a dangerous man for even a Duchess to snub, and she
let him go in peace.

But the Duke, who dared not go out, remained to her; and he went to bed
that night feeling that the world may be made very unpleasant, even for
a Duke.




CHAPTER V

THE MAN WHO GUESSED


Countess Alexia of Rohnburg had had a few of her intimate friends to
luncheon at the house in Green Street, and the last of them, Mary
Riverdale, was still sitting with her in cosy chat when a note was
brought in. That her hostess did not like the look of the handwriting
on the envelope, Miss Riverdale was sure. But she forbore the comment
to which her intimacy might have entitled her, and contented herself
with running through a picture book while Alexia read the note.

“Is--any one waiting?” the Countess had asked.

“No, madame,” answered the man, unsatisfyingly laconic, as became his
position.

Alexia read the note, restored it to its envelope and put it, address
downwards, on the table. Her visitor threw aside the _Graphic_, and
for a few moments there was a constrained silence, a pause of mental
self-consciousness, almost awkward, considering how intimate the
two were. But both of them, young though they might be, were too
experienced players in that everyday game of social diplomacy to let an
embarrassment become manifest. Yet there will assert itself, in spite
of tact and artifice, a certain instinct which tells us our companions
are reading our thoughts and gauging our dilemmas.

“I wonder what the next development of the Vaux House mystery will
be,” Miss Riverdale observed, quoting the headline of the _Daily Comet_.

The affair had, as was natural, been the subject of animated discussion
at luncheon, and it seemed scarcely worth while to reopen it.

The Countess gave a shrug. “We must wait and see,” she answered
mechanically. “The poor Duchess! One almost feels one ought to leave
cards of enquiry.”

“The poor Duke,” laughed her friend. “They will get more fun out of him
than ever. Not but what this is a serious matter.”

“You really think so?” The talk was being sustained by an effort on
both sides, and Alexia’s question sounded suspiciously like covering a
yawn.

“Don’t you?” the other returned, in languid surprise.

“Oh, yes, I suppose so. If it is all true.”

“Of course if it isn’t true we shall have a disclaimer from the
Lancashires to-morrow.”

“I mean the connection between the broken ornament, the little sword,
or whatever it is, and poor Captain Martindale’s death. You knew him,
Mary?”

“Only by sight. You did, dear, didn’t you?”

“Casually. Meeting him about. As a matter of fact I was to have danced
with him at the very time he was found dead.”

“Alix! You never told me that. How awful!”

“It might have been,” the Countess responded composedly. “But I did not
see him. It was late; a good many people had gone. He did not come for
his dance; then there was a fuss: we were told, at least I was, that
Captain Martindale had had a fit, and people went off. I fancy most of
the men knew the real state of the case.”

Miss Riverdale gave a little shudder. “Horrible! At a dance, too.”

“Yes. It was upsetting, even to us who did not know the truth. As we
were going, a doctor bustled in, shivering in a great-coat buttoned up
to hide the fact that he was only half dressed. I have often thought
that great-coat in the ball-room brought home the idea of a tragedy
more vividly than the sight of the dead man could have done. Ugh! Don’t
let’s talk about it any more, or I shall get the blues.”

Her visitor rose. “You look, my dear Alix, as though you had them
already. Come across the Park with me. I am going that way home; we are
pretty sure to meet some one to enliven us.”

Alexia shook her head. “I was out all the morning and am rather tired.
I feel too dull even to ask you to stay.”

Miss Riverdale scarcely needed a hint to see that she had suddenly
become _de trop_. She wondered whether her hostess’s sudden
preoccupation was not due to the letter just received; but to wonder
was all that was permitted her.

Scarcely had the door closed upon her visitor when Alexia took up the
note and read it through again, and this time there was no need for her
to hide her disquietude. The words were few.

  “DEAR COUNTESS,--

  “I have something of great importance to say to you; if you read the
  papers you will doubtless guess to what I refer. Will you, in your
  own interest, be good enough to remove for once the embargo you have
  laid on my visits, and be at home when I call at four this afternoon?

                                                “Yours sincerely,

                                                      “AUBREY PLAYFORD.”

She read it through twice, and as she did so, she seemed to be
struggling to evade the grip of a strong will that lurked beneath the
words. Then, mechanically, she put the note back into its envelope and
turned to glance at the clock. It was nearly four. She hesitated for a
few moments, as taking counsel with herself; then rang the bell.

“I am at home to Mr. Playford when he calls this afternoon,” she told
the man, giving the order with a plain-spoken authority which disarmed
all suspicion of an impropriety.

She had not long to wait before the expected visitor was announced.

Playford came in deferentially confident and inscrutable, and as Alexia
rose to receive him her eyes met his boldly in a look of challenge.

“Bring tea,” she said casually to the man as he left the room. She was
not going to indue this unwelcome visit with any mysterious importance.

“It was good of you, Countess, to grant my request,” Playford said,
as he sat down, and let his eyes rest with covetous admiration on the
beautiful woman before him. “I hope it has not been inconvenient; but
the matter on which it was necessary to see you was urgent.”

“Not at all,” she answered coolly. “I have had some people to luncheon,
and they have only just gone. What did you want to tell me?”

“I gave you a hint, Countess, in my note.”

“Please explain it.”

“You did not understand it?” The tone was incredulous; coupled with the
sly look, almost offensively so.

“Not in the least,” Alexia returned simply, so directly as to blunt the
point of the insinuation.

But Playford was not the man to show a repulse. “It is about this
business at Vaux House,” he said, with quiet incisiveness.

“Oh? What of that? How does it concern me?”

If she was playing a part, her skill called forth his grudging
admiration; grudging because he knew from her tone that, except under
duress, she was not for him.

“You know, Countess,” he replied, speaking now with forced directness;
“you have seen that the little jewelled sword, a hair ornament, with
which Reggie Martindale was killed, has been found?”

“Yes,” she responded casually; “I saw that in the paper.”

He told himself, as he watched her, that she had gone a shade paler;
that was all; and he could not be quite certain of that.

“Do you believe it?” she added, as he paused, so to speak, on the
strike.

“It is true enough,” he said, in a tone that took the question out of
the region of the debatable. “Reggie Martindale was done to death that
night; why--only one person, probably, on this earth knows; but that he
did not die a natural death has all along been almost an open secret.”

“Has it?” she observed simply, yet with the slightest touch of
contradiction. “Yes; well, I have heard as much. Mr. Dormer Greetland
was telling us a long story about it a day or two ago. Still, I don’t
see how it concerns me.”

She was better entrenched against his attack, he was forced to admit,
than he had thought to find her; still, the defence should not serve.

“I’m afraid it does concern you, Countess, very nearly,” he replied, in
a tone dark with impending mischief.

“Tell me how, Mr. Playford.”

He gave a slight bow, as accepting the challenge. “I have seen this
little weapon, the tiny sword; a dangerous ornament, Countess.”

“Yes?” There seemed little more than a half-amused curiosity in her
tone.

“The Duchess showed it to me, and--I recognized it.”

Alexia laughed. “Ah, now I know. I think I have guessed this mysterious
piece of news. I suppose you are going to say that you have recognized
this formidable ornament as belonging to me.”

Manifestly he did not like the words being taken out of his mouth, but
he could only respond, with a slight bow of assent, “You have guessed
it, Countess.”

She laughed again. “My dear Mr. Playford, what an absurd idea!” Any
one would have thought from her manner and his that she had him
discomfited; but Aubrey Playford was not the man to be so easily beaten
off.

“Hardly absurd, Countess.” That was all he could say, for the door
opened and tea was brought in.

“Is the poor Duke very much upset?” Alexia enquired, giving the
necessary turn to the conversation while the men were in the room.

Playford gave an appropriately humorous answer as to the ducal state
of mind, all the while eyeing the girl searchingly, and in spite of
himself, inclined to wonder whether, after all, he might not have made
a mistake.

When they were alone once more, their talk did not for the moment
revert to its former and more dangerous channel. Perhaps both were glad
of an armistice after the first trial of strength, of a short breathing
space now that the methods of attack and defence were declared. Alexia
poured out the two cups of tea, and did not raise her eyes from the
table until Playford had taken his cup. Then she leaned back in her
chair and faced him boldly as ever.

“You come here to tell me that?”

His eyes were on her, alert as a fencer’s. “Could I do otherwise?”

“Surely,” she returned, with something like contempt. “Even if it were
true.”

“I don’t think I have made a mistake, Countess.” He spoke slowly with a
staccato enunciation of the words.

“You have, Mr. Playford.” The cool incisiveness of her tone stung him.

“How?” he asked, with an ugly look of fight in his malicious eyes.

She was ready with her answer. “To begin with, in coming here at all;
to a house, I mean, where you might know you would not be welcome.”

“Obviously,” he retorted with a smile, “as the bearer of unwelcome
news.”

“Which, if true, would be no news.”

The hit was palpable, but he gave no sign that he felt it. “I came to
warn you,” he said, still watching her darkly.

“It was very kind of you,” she returned, with a touch of contemptuous
irony, “and quite unnecessary.”

Manifestly the time for fencing was past. Playford rose, ostensibly to
put down his cup, but he remained standing over her. “Countess,” he
began, in a tone that had a deeper vibration in it, “Alexia----”

She raised her head imperiously. “Mr. Playford, I have forbidden you to
address me in that manner.”

“I know,” he assented. “And you have forbidden me your house.”

She gave a little scornful nod of agreement.

“For no adequate reason,” he protested. “My presumption, as no doubt
you would call it----”

“Persecution,” she corrected.

“Not persecution,” he argued. “That is a hard word to use towards a man
whose love overmasters him and makes him unduly importunate.”

“A man,” she replied, and from her tone she might have been discussing
the point merely from an academical point of view, “a man who cannot
control his feelings, but allows them to get the better of him to the
annoyance of others, deserves to be kept at a distance, even as you
have been.”

The last touch perceptibly stung him. There was an unpleasant gleam in
his eye as he returned, “But I am determined my state of banishment
from you shall last no longer.”

Her dark eyes were raised in half-amused scorn. “Indeed? I think that
rests with me rather than with you, Mr. Playford.”

“It did,” he retorted viciously; “but it does no longer.” He bent over
her. “Alexia----”

She motioned him away, and rose. “No,” she said, for the first time
showing anger; “I will not allow you to call me that.”

“I think you will,” he returned. “Let us understand one another.”

“If you think there is any misapprehension,” she said, now cold again;
“there is none on my part.”

“I think there is,” he rejoined significantly.

“No,” she maintained scornfully. “I can reckon you up, Mr. Playford. I
am sorry you should have thought proper to come here to threaten me.”

“Have I?” he broke in protestingly. “Have I threatened you?”

“If not,” she answered, “I confess I do not see the drift of what you
have said.”

“In my own justification, let me tell you,” he urged. “Please.”

Alexia resumed her seat with a significant glance at the clock. “I hope
it will not take you very long.”

How he hated her, this scornful, imperious beauty, who was meeting his
attack so skilfully; hated her for her contempt and rejection of him,
yet loved her with a fierceness and pervasiveness which he was, with
all his self-control, unable to subdue; while he hated and cursed the
bands of the passion that encompassed him.

“I certainly did not come here to threaten you, Countess,” he began, in
a tone schooled almost to apology. “I should hardly have brought myself
to repay your graciousness in receiving me by an action so ill as that.
I have simply come here, led, driven by an impulse which you forbid me
to name, to make a proposition to you, or, if you prefer the word, a
bargain with you.”

Lying back in her low chair, her eyes fixed almost dreamily upon the
little gold pencil-case which she lazily pushed in and out, she just
lifted them for an instant to Playford’s face, then lowered them again.
But from the light of that instant’s glance he saw no encouragement.

“It is easy,” he went on, for the pause had been but momentary, and
Alexia showed no desire to interrupt him, “it is easy to moralize and
to propound codes of so-called honour, but when a man is possessed by
a love as desperate, as all-absorbing as mine, he is scarcely to be
blamed if, while human nature remains as it is, he seizes any advantage
which fate may give him.”

“Advantage?” she repeated thoughtfully. “You say Fate has given you an
advantage--over me?”

There was an infinity of suggestion, of latent disdain, in the question.

“Don’t let us put it that way, Countess,” he protested.

“The word was yours, not mine,” she returned.

“True. But the application was yours. Let us look the situation
squarely in the face,” he proceeded, anxious now to come to the point,
lest the interview should be interrupted before he had declared
himself. “Don’t you think that, as you and I are, presumably, the only
people in the world who know your secret, we--we might share more than
that?”

He paused for her answer, but none came. Her attitude suggested that
she was waiting for him to go on to the end, if it were not already
reached.

“Countess!”

Thus called upon, she looked up.

“With regard to your proposal,” she said, in quite a matter-of-fact
tone, “it has the disadvantage of being based upon false premises.”

“How?”

“You talk of my secret--dangerous secret, I think you called it. I
have no secret, dangerous or harmless, that can be shared by you--or
anything else.”

He took a step nearer and lowered his tone as he replied, “This is
absurd, Countess. You will not put me off so. The little weapon with
which Martindale was killed belonged to you.”

“Indeed?” She gave a laugh. “I do not admit that for an instant; but,
supposing it did, what then?”

He had scarcely expected this unwavering defence, this absence of any
sign of fear in her. He was bound now to fight without compunction.

“It would, naturally, coupled with other circumstances, raise a very
ugly suspicion against you.”

“What other circumstances?”

“Won’t you render it unnecessary for me to mention them?”

“How?”

“By letting me be no longer out of favour with you,” he pleaded.

“I prefer to hear the other circumstances.” She was hatefully cold and
contemptuous, he told himself; wishing almost that he had not come on
this errand which promised him as little satisfaction as honour.

“You were in that little room with Martindale,” he said, with an effort
to save the situation. “You were seen to come out of it not long before
his death was discovered.”

“Seen? By whom?”

“By me, for one.”

“Ah!” There was infinite significance in the exclamation.

“He was known to be an admirer of yours.”

“Do I kill my admirers?” She rose. “You are giving me a terrible, a
really mediæval character, Mr. Playford. I wonder you trusted yourself
here alone. But perhaps you left word with the police before you
ventured to knock at the door. Is there anything more you have to say
to me? It is getting late.”

She had beaten him at every point, turned every lunge he had thought
to make with deadly effect. The sting of her sarcasm made him furious;
as furious as a man of his self-contained temperament could ever show
himself to be.

He could hardly prolong the interview now, after her unmistakable hint;
and if he did, it must be with little hope of gaining his point. She
meant fighting, if it were forced upon her, and, so far, her defence
had been perfect.

“Then do I understand you to deny, Countess, that the little dagger is
yours?” he asked bluntly, with an expression of rankling defeat on his
face.

“I know nothing of it,” she answered, with contemptuous indifference;
“and if I did, I should scarcely be inclined, after your somewhat
objectionable proposal, to discuss the matter with you.”

As she made a move towards the 

In a few minutes he was, still in the exaltation of this wondrous love
that he had found, speeding away to a common-place, sordid consultation
in a company case. What contrasts the world holds, he thought; and
suddenly found himself heartily in agreement with Gastineau’s late
indictment of their profession. It was difficult to bring his mind
down from that seventh heaven to the mundane level of advising a knot
of greedy money-grubbers how to avoid a certain disgorgement of undue
profits which threatened them. For the time hating and despising a
profession which made him, the, nominally honourable, adviser of
dishonest men, he kept himself rigidly from all show of sympathy
with the sharp practitioners who sat before him; and held, without
a suggestion of helpfulness to the dry questions of law which were
involved. And when the smart solicitor had carried off his dissatisfied
clients, arguing with glib tenacity the chances of law versus equity,
he threw himself back in his chair with a sigh of unutterable relief
that the air of the room was purer, and that he could indulge the
delight of his new-found happiness.

Then a troublesome thought arose to check the delight of his reverie,
his immediate interview with Gastineau, the time for which was almost
come. He remembered how Gastineau had practically ordered him to attend
that evening. It was galling; behind the distastefulness was, perhaps,
a touch of apprehension. And indeed a brave man may be excused fear of
the methods of an unscrupulous opponent. It is fighting in the dark,
and courage may well fail where it can avail nothing. Still, with all
his reluctance to meet Gastineau under their altered relationship,
Herriard was glad to think that the projected interview might also show
him where he stood: he might, though it was unlikely, get an inkling
of Gastineau’s plans, and whether he intended to resume his pursuit of
Alexia. That he was feverishly anxious to know, since on it depended
the question whether or not he was to be involved in a terribly unequal
struggle with a man of abnormal cunning and determination. Yes; if it
were to come, it was as well that it should come at once; suspense was
unbearable.

Herriard rose and prepared to go out. He would dine at a restaurant
near at hand, then start off for Mayfair and get the business over. As
he opened the door of his chambers a man stood outside who raised his
